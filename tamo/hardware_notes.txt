problem w/ v1 batt boards was that ATTINY pin 6 was attached to the batt V+, which stopped it from being programmable via ISP. Additionally, I missed a wire connection between the Vregulator and a resistor which meant the batt couldn't be charged

full brightness test lasts 1:45ish

should health be totally linked to battery charge??

new design needs to:

let the ATTIny measure batt voltage
move the case screen hole up (and move the screen down a bit)
    = in general, this should be more accurate 
have a better spot for the third pin of the batt board so it doesn't poke the battery in the back
