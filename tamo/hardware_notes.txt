problem w/ v1 batt boards was that ATTINY pin 6 was attached to the batt V+, which stopped it from being programmable via ISP. Additionally, I missed a wire connection between the Vregulator and a resistor which meant the batt couldn't be charged

full brightness test lasts 1:45ish

should health be totally linked to battery charge??

new design needs to:

let the ATTIny measure batt voltage
move the case screen hole up (and move the screen down a bit)
    = in general, this should be more accurate 
have a better spot for the third pin of the batt board so it doesn't poke the battery in the back

thinking that i could get rid of the eyeball thinking sprite to save some space
also, there's gotta be a good way of sleeping the ATTiny between each animation frame for max power savings

what about instead of holding the button feeding tamo, it brings up a menu where you can:
feed
medicine
clean?

also, to save space, you could write a function that superimposes the talking sprites over the speech bubble sprite
would go from 17B per speech to 8B per speech ==> x10 ==> 90bytes saved (+code overhead)
this could also work for the thinking sprites, so +another 30bytes

this could be generalized for sprites that are less than 8 wide

- when voltage drops, tamo will talk about it when spoken to
- and tamo will be sad, even when you feed him (doesn't get happy after)
